/**
 * Play a one-shot animation WHEN THE VISITOR CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT — once.
 *
 * History, because it went wrong three times and each reason matters:
 *
 *  1. Fired on a setTimeout ~370ms after paint. Measured live, the diagram sat
 *     785px down on desktop / 1213px on mobile, so it played at 13% visibility
 *     or entirely off-screen and was static before anyone scrolled to it.
 *
 *  2. Fired at `intersectionRatio >= 0.25`, which on a ~700px diagram is the
 *     top ~175px sliver. Same failure, milder. A ratio is the wrong rule for a
 *     tall element — hence `readyToPlay()` below, which asks whether the
 *     diagram's MIDDLE is on screen.
 *
 *  3. Bailed out entirely on prefers-reduced-motion — including when the
 *     visitor pressed Replay. Anyone with the OS setting on (common on Windows)
 *     saw a permanently frozen diagram and a dead button. Reported from
 *     production as "completely unresponsive", and they were right.
 *
 * The rule now: reduced motion suppresses AUTOPLAY only. An explicit press is a
 * request for motion and is always honoured.
